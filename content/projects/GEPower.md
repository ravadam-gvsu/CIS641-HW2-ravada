ACE(Automated Commercial Environment) is a module used by U.S. exporters to
electronically declare their international exports, known as Electronic Export Information (EEI),
to the Census Bureau to help compile U.S. export and trade statistics
An exporter can file the EEI electronically to the ACE using the AESDirect ACE website. After
an EEI/SED is successfully filed and processed, the shipper receives an Internal Transaction
Number (ITN) to put on the shipping documents, as a confirmation to any government agent
inspecting the cargo prior to departure.
