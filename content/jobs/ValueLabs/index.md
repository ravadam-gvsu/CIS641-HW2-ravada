- Worked with a team of five developers to build a LiveOps Automation module for migrating database versions that reduced the database migration time by 70% compared to manual processes, resulting in a decrease in downtime during updates.
- Code was written and deployed on AWS cloud platform. When compared to on-premises infrastructure, we saved 30% while retaining great availability and scalability. Furthermore, used serverless architecture with AWS Lambda and microservices communication using AWS SQS which reduced operational costs and improved system reliability.
- Worked on ALTUS team to build user management application. Created Micro Frontends using Angular Single SPA to improve page loading speed and decrease load time for end-users.
